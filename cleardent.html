    <h1>ClearDent Case Study</h1>

      <li>Outsourced Marketing Consultant</li>
      <li><u>Design Lead (UI/UX Design & Web Development)</u></li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Timeline</h6>
    <p>
      September - December 2018 (12 weeks)
    </p>

    <h3><b>Eearly Insights from users: </b>Need for Restructuring the Information Architecture</b></h3>
    <img class="w-100 rounded" src="asset\img\screenshot-nav-01.png"
      alt="A Screenshot of previous website's navigation problem">
    <p class="img-description text-muted"><i>Previous website's navigation</i></p>
    <h6>Solutions vs Features</h6>
    <p>
      The navigation was mainly focused on showing the line of products while not providing enough information on
      what 'solutions' can be offered to the specific needs of the users. As a software 'solutions' provider, this key
      information were missing to inform the buyers' decision.
    </p>
    <h6>Renaming the products/features</h6>
    <p>
      The naming convention for the products were confusing majority of the new website visitors. While the website was
      displaying the actual product names, it was not conveying information on what product offers.
    </p>
    <h6>Creating the content focused website</h6>
    <p>
      With the company's new content-driven marketing strategy, the website needed to equip a robust resource library which 
      can cater blogs and gated-contents such as eBooks and whitepapers.
    </p>
    <h6>Confusion for users looking for customer support</h6>
    <p>Based on the pageview trends and its importance, entire menu strucutre has been redesigned. 
    </p>
    <h6>Reprioritizing the information hirerchy</h6>
    <p>Based on the pageview trends and its importance, entire menu strucutre has been redesigned. 
    </p>
    <h3><b>New navigation structure:</b> Updating the look</h3>
    <h4>Before</h4>
    <img class="w-100 rounded" src="asset/img/navigation-before.png">
    <h4>After</h4>
    <img class="w-100 rounded" src="asset/img/navigation-after.png">
    <h3><b>Refining the visuals:</b> Updating the look</h3>
    <h6>Typefaces</h6>
    <p>
      Futura PT for heading, Nunito for Body type; The classic font Futura was chosen for the typeface to communicate
      the boldness
    </p>
    <h6>Colors</h6>
    <p>
      Since the visual branding was not changing, and the management only preferred the incremental changes, I have
      saturated the original blend of primary and secondary color, Blue and Orange for its visibility and liveliness.
    </p>
    <h6>Design Guidelines</h6>
    <p>
      The design system was created for the internal use for both Marketing and R&D team's use, and the system was being
      actively used for the new web app development which I was lucky to be a small part of in their deisgn initiative.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Implementation</b></h4>
    <p>
      The Implementation process consisted of multiple iterations which required weekly brainstorming sessions and
      feedback from all team members and stakeholders. <u>[Show diagrams of: Ideation -> design -> prototype ->
        implementation]</u>
    </p>
    <p><strong>[Few pictures of wireframes, paper prototype, excel sheets, Adobe XD]</strong></p>
    <h4><b>Takeaways for this project</b></h4>
    <p>
      Since it was my first project experience as a 'design lead', It was not an easy tasks to manage the timeline of
      the projects since there were quite a lot of dependencies on the copywriting side of the project. It looks like I
      could possibly gain more insights from industry mentors on how they usually manage a such project. Due to the
      tight project timeline, and the nature of my role taking two duties as a designer and a developer, a proper
      high-fieldity prototyping was not in place everytime. And the timeline might have been overly ambitious. If I were
      to do lead the project, I would
